HUMAN was founded in 2012 in a Brooklyn sci-fi bookstore by Tamer Hassan, Michael Tiffany, Dan Kaminsky, and Ash Kalb. Our humble beginnings led to the creation of the Human Defense Platform, the backbone of all our products that safeguards enterprises from sophisticated bot attacks, fraud, and account abuse. Today we verify the humanity of more than 20 trillion interactions per week for some of the largest companies and internet platforms.

Our hacker roots still permeate everything we do. You will be a part of the HUMAN front line in our commitment to helping protect companies (and in turn, their customers) from both revenue and reputation risk caused by malicious bots. However, HUMAN is not the center of this story. Humans like yourself are. We firmly believe in putting people first. This approach spans our extensive total rewards package, inclusive of competitive compensation, benefits, stipends - as well as our day-to-day culture - to ensure every human is empowered to do the best work of their life.

This role is at the intersection of data, technology, and business as we aspire to deeply understand how actors are perpetrating schemes and develop a powerful product to delight our customers.

What you'll do:

Identify impactful detection leads that increase velocity from time of threat identification to implementation of mitigation in HUMAN products
Deploy stop-gap defenses for emerging threats through the development of analyses, models, algorithms, and dashboards
Deploy long-term defenses based on statistical analysis of supply chain data and fraud actor behavior
Deliver new customer-facing features through collaboration with Product and Engineering teams team
Build complex queries and reports to analyze historical data, including the use of techniques such as: sub-queries, temp tables, complex joins, variables
Triage customer and internal inquiries about fraud efficacy by acting as first line of analysis
Maintain product excellence and efficiency through improvements to existing techniques and tooling that reduce the time to understand a new detection lead and process it

We are on a mission to protect the integrity of the internet for everyone, so we welcome all individuals to come to share their unique experiences and perspectives as we fight against cybercrime together!

With Humans located in all parts of the world, we’ve fully embraced our diversity of thought and are always looking for innovative ways to connect with one another - even in virtual reality! Although New York City is our HQ, we have teams in Tel Aviv, Israel; London, UK; Victoria, Canada; San Mateo, CA; Miami, FL; and Virginia. We trust our Humans in choosing where they work and how they work. The total rewards package we provide reflects our commitment to our Humans’ personal career development, which includes annual stipends for home office setup, wellbeing, and learning & development.
