 Athenian Project  : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Lead Data Engineer (Machine Learning),Abridge,United States (Remote),"About the job
Health care is all about conversations, with over 2B spoken conversations each year between patients and their care teams in just the United States. However, people forget up to 80% of those conversations, leading to worse patient outcomes. And doctors are burning out writing notes in their EMRs instead of focusing on their patients. That’s where Abridge comes in — our audio-based standalone and integrated solutions record and summarize medical conversations, anywhere care happens.

The Role
We’re looking for a Lead Data Engineer to help us design, build, and operate the data platform required to scale our business at the forefront of machine learning in healthcare. You’ll work alongside our growing team of engineers, analysts, and other stakeholders to create the next generation of our data pipeline and warehouse, and you will work with our machine learning scientists to ensure they have timely, secure and compliant access to the data they need to train our machine learning models.

What You'll Do
Lead the end-to-end design, development, testing, and deployment of our data pipelines and warehouse, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and data quality. You will evaluate, recommend, and implement the technologies, tools, and processes we need.
Collaborate closely with machine learning scientists, data scientists, product managers engineers, and commercial leaders to understand data requirements and translate them into technical solutions that you will implement.
Ensure the security, compliance, and privacy of data through implementation of necessary protocols and best practices.
Stay updated with industry trends and advancements in data engineering and bring innovative ideas to continuously improve our data processes.
Monitor and troubleshoot data pipeline and warehouse quality and performance issues, ensuring smooth operation and proactively addressing potential bottlenecks.

What You'll Bring
6+ years of Data Engineering experience in a cloud-first organization
Experience at fast-growing startup(s), building and operating data pipelines and warehouses from the ground up. You have either built your organization’s first data pipeline, or have been the lead on a project to overhaul or replace a pipeline.
Knowledgeable about governance issues, and know how to secure sensitive information such as PHI, PII, or financial data without compromising its utility
Experienced with machine learning. You may or may not have first-hand experience with ML but you have actively supported the work of ML engineers/scientists.
Experience with tooling for the modern Data tech stack, including:
Data Orchestration (Airflow, Flyte)
Data Streaming (Kafka, Kinesis)
Batch Processing (Spark, Flink)
Data Warehousing (Snowflake, BigQuery)
Data Transformation (Fivetran, dbt, Airbyte)

Plus much more!

Life at Abridge
At Abridge, we’re driven by our mission to bring understanding and follow-through to every medical conversation. Our culture is founded on doing things the “inverse” way in a legacy system—focusing on patients, instead of the system; focusing on outcomes, instead of billing; and focusing on the end-user experience, instead of a hospital administrator's mandate.

Abridgers are engineers, scientists, designers, and health policy experts from a diverse set of backgrounds—an experiment in alchemy that helps us transform an industry dominated by EHRs and enterprise into a consumer-driven experience, one recording at a time. We believe in strong ideas, loosely held, and place a high premium on a growth mindset. We push each other to grow and expose each other to the latest in our respective fields. Whether it’s holding a PhD-level deep dive into understanding fairness and underlying bias in machine learning models, debating the merits of a Scandinavian design philosophy in our UI/UX, or writing responses for Medicare rules to influence U.S. health policy, we prioritize sharing our findings across the team and helping each other be successful.

Diversity & Inclusion
Abridge is an equal opportunity employer. Diversity and inclusion is at the core of what we do. We actively welcome applicants from all backgrounds (including but not limited to race, gender, educational background, and sexual orientation).

Pay Transparency
Salary ranges are based on pay transparency guidelines, a reasonable expectation for the salary range is listed, which applies to California, Colorado, New Jersey, New York, and Washington. The base salary range for other locations may vary. Actual base salary will be dependent on relevant experience, skills, qualifications, and/or other job-related factors. As a part of the total compensation package, this role may also be eligible to participate in a company stock option plan. Salary listed does not include total compensation (e.g. equity, etc).

Staying Safe - Protect Yourself From Recruitment Fraud
 We are aware of individuals and entities fraudulently representing themselves as Abridge recruiters and/or hiring managers. Abridge will never ask for financial information or payment, or for personal information such as bank account number or social security number during the job application or interview process. Any emails from the Abridge recruiting team will come from an @abridge.com email address. You can learn more about how to protect yourself from these types of fraud by referring to this article.

 Athenian Project  : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

What Makes Cloudflare Special?

We’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.

Project Galileo : We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.

 Athenian Project  : We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.

Path Forward Partnership : Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.

1.1.1.1 : We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.

Technical leaders will support you in solving problems that has already been tackled and look to you to advocate for the best technical solutions for your product where those standards might not be a fit. In the future, you will coordinate with the client and its vendor(s) to determine an appropriate organizational structure to support ongoing production and operations.

Qualifications
You'll be a good fit for this role if you have experience:
Leading development teams and reporting to executives. This is a senior role. You will be in a position to provide guidance and set direction related to advanced technical concepts. You will also be expected to coordinate and communicate with both business and technical stakeholders.
Working with large-scale web applications. The solutions you will oversee will be available to millions of constituents.

Data Infrastructure Engineer ,Headway,United States (Remote),"About the job
Headway’s mission is a big one - to build a new mental health care system everyone can access. We’ve built technology that helps people find great therapists with the first software-enabled national network of providers accepting insurance.

1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don’t accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to take insurance and scale their practice.

Headway was founded in 2019 – since then, we’ve grown into a diverse, national network of over 25,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software. We’re a Series C company with over $225m in funding from a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Thrive Capital, and Health Care Service Corporation.

We want your time here to be the most meaningful experience of your career. Join us, and help change mental healthcare for the better.

About Infrastructure At Headway

Building a new mental healthcare system at Headway is only possible because of the scale and leverage that software can provide. The infrastructure engineering team at Headway is a small but mighty team building our AWS infrastructure, automated deploy processes, and developer experience that helps us deliver a best-in-class experience for our patients and therapists.

Please note that this is not a data engineering role. 

Principles that guide us:

Focus on the mission: We view software as a means of effecting change in the world, not as an end unto itself. We write software to empower our patients and therapist to better solve the problems they’re facing.

Ship small, learn fast: We are building new and novel products and believe that we learn what our users need by quickly shipping and iteration.

Everything is a product: Whether it's our patient search experience or a developer productivity improvement, we treat everything we build at Headway as a product with end-users in mind.

Optimize for trust: We believe that engineers should be continually learning. To learn effectively and to be productive, engineers must feel safe asking questions and discussing mistakes.

Who you are

We’re looking for data-focused infrastructure engineers who have the ability to deal with ambiguity and learn new technologies and systems in a fast-paced, high-growth environment. Below are some additional experiences we think help engineers succeed at Headway.

Experience we’re seeking: 

3+ years experience as an Infrastructure Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), DevOps, or Software Engineer with a focus on building data infrastructure for high growth data functions (DS/DE/Analytics).

Experience with monitoring and APM tools (Datadog, New Relic, etc.)
Experience building robust data pipelines, ideally in Spark
Experience working with and maintaining Airflow infrastructure
Understanding of ETL/ELT best practices and technologies
Experience with data security and compliance, particularly in a regulated environment

You'll love this role if you want to:

Change the trajectory of a startup striving to redefine access to mental health in America
Work on a highly collaborative, cross-functional engineering team in order to build the best products for therapists, patients, physician and payer partners, and/or your teammates at Headway
Build and improve tooling to make engineering more streamlined and efficient
Help establish and engrain best practices throughout our codebases
Work in a fast-paced, iterative development process -- we release changes to our products multiple times per day!
Contribute to our engineering culture, processes, and documentation with the same thought and care that we do our software (one of our engineering cultural principles is “Everything is a Product”)
