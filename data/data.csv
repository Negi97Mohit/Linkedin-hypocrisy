Comfortable with uncertainty in analysis and outcomes
Experienced in leading conversations and problem solving with clients
Prepared to travel for on-site work (must have a driver's license)

A Little About E Source

Utilities across the US and Canada face the same fundamental, day-to-day challenges: to ensure reliable service for every customer while maintaining and modernizing aging distribution networks and meeting regulatory requirements-all while keeping rates affordable. At the same time, climate change has created a common, universal call to action: to reduce our carbon impact, improve our environment, and ensure the prosperity of future generations.

At E Source, We're Dedicated To Helping Every Utility Become a Sustainable Utility. That Means Doing The Hard Work It Takes To Achieve Goals That Often Seem At Odds With One Another

Environmental responsibility: Decarbonizing operations, reducing emissions, eliminating water leaks, and finding efficiencies
Reliability: Providing safe, continuous, and consistent service in the face of increasing volatility caused by climate change, including extreme weather, drought, and fire
Equity: Making services and programs truly available to all, especially low- and moderate-income residential customers and small and midsize businesses who are often disproportionately impacted by societal events
Financial stability: Ensuring a bottom line that affords capital and operational expenditures while enabling innovation and giving back to our communities

E Source blends industry-leading research, predictive data science, and solution services to help utilities make better decisions to serve their customers, their bottom line, and our planet. With a commitment to practical innovation, we use more than three decades of utility-focused experience and our unique solution set to help our clients become a Sustainable Utility.

Benefits

We offer excellent insurance packages, including medical, dental, and vision plans; company-paid life insurance; company-paid long- and short-term disability insurance; and medical and dependent-care flexible spending plans.
We provide a flexible time off (FTO) program; E Source employees can take as many paid days off per year as they need, with manager approval, while fulfilling their work obligations and ensuring proper coverage of their responsibilities.
